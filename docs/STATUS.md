# FETCH! Status

As of Sat 24 Oct 2026, 14:15. Rules: `docs/BIBLE.md`. Decisions: the review board, https://claude.ai/artifact/36whD8obiWsrZc4AvPCdXk.

## Main

- `main` is **v0.6** (1b5a30f, Fri 20:15). Nothing merged since.

## Integration branch: `prod/integrate` (27be9b4)

Everything waiting, in one playable build (`FETCH_PREVIEW_24oct_g.love` on the owner's Mac). All checks pass: PEPPER UNCHANGED, flow 125/125, Tiled, QA 0 problems on all six levels.
- `ui/hud-v8`: every screen in the new UI (title, menu, options, controls, level select cards, intro, talk panel, hint bubbles, pause, tally show, story, game over, ending, Fetch Frenzy, sound toast). No old style left.
- `ui/panel-hud`: no HUD row under centred cards.
- `ui/review-fixes`: from an independent review of all 65 screens. Locked cards show the real picture, empty sockets for medals not won, story and Mia lines at most 6 words a child knows (list: CHANGELOG), sniff taught by a hint bubble, Pepper in her colours on hint pictures, FETCH FRENZY! the only bonus name, ALL CAUGHT!, pieces inside panels, smaller HUD score. `ui/umlaut`: SÖDER with a capital Ö.
- `art/pilot-oldtown`, `art/placement`, `r9/levels` (Rooftops 23 screens, Night Harbour ball fix), `ops/regroup` (playtest kit).
- Title picture: the material cleanup (a1e0e15). Not taken: the hand shading pass on `ui/title-sheen` (owner: bad shading). Tried and not better: `art/title-light` (keeps the shading but stays mottled).

## Waiting for the owner (max 3)

1. Play `_g`. Then merge `prod/integrate` into main as v0.7? (recommended: yes, after his play).
2. Logo and tagline: which logo (clean, gradient, bands, steps6) and which tagline (capitals or lowercase).
3. Child playtest with the kit (`docs/playtest_kit.md`).

## Known, next

- River Walk scale calls from the placement audit (houses, lamps, railing a third to half of true size).
- Greybox labels still show in Söder Hill and Night Harbour levels (they go with their art).
- `layout_qa8.py` crashes on pause frames (expects the old row boxes): update it.
- Two producer sessions worked the same branches on 24 Oct. From now on the producer is the session using the `fetch-game-manager` skill. The nightly run (22:39) uses `night/*` branches only.

## Credits

- SpriteCook: about 1,078. Artlist: about 42,450. 0 spent on 24 Oct.

How to update this file: rewritten by the producer session at the end of each working session.
